[{"bio":"The son of comparative literature professor August Coppola (a brother of director Francis Ford Coppola) and dancer/choreographer Joy Vogelsang, Cage changed his name early in his career to make his own reputation, succeeding brilliantly with a host of classic, quirky roles by the late 1980s. Initially studying theatre at Beverly Hills High (though he dropped out at 17), he secured a bit part in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) -- most of which was cut, dashing his hopes and leading to a job selling popcorn at the Fairfax Theater, thinking that would be the only route to a movie career. But a job reading lines with auditionees for uncle Francis' Rumble Fish (1983) landed him a role in that film, followed by the punk-rocker in Valley Girl (1983), which was released first and truly launched his career. His one-time passion for method acting reached a personal limit when he smashed a street-vendor's remote-control car to achieve the sense of rage needed for his gangster character in The Cotton Club (1984). In his early 20s, he dated Jenny Wright for two years and later linked to Uma Thurman. After a relationship of several years with Christina Fulton, a model, they split amicably and share custody of a son, Weston Cage (b.1992). - IMDb Mini Biography By: Dan Hartung <dhartung@mcs.com>","birthName":"Nicholas Kim Coppola","dateOfBirth":"7 January 1964","filmographies":[{"filmography":[{"IMDBId":"tt2850386","remarks":["Grug (voice)"],"title":"The Croods 2","year":" 2017"},{"IMDBId":"tt3513538","remarks":["(rumored)"],"title":"Men with No Fear","year":" 2015"},{"IMDBId":"tt1197627","remarks":["(rumored)"],"title":"National Treasure 3","year":" "},{"IMDBId":"tt3733778","title":"Pay the Ghost","year":" "},{"IMDBId":"tt3687398","title":"The Runner","year":" 2015"},{"IMDBId":"tt1274586","title":"Dying of the Light","year":" 2015"},{"IMDBId":"tt2467046","title":"Left Behind","year":" 2014/I"},{"IMDBId":"tt1552224","title":"Outcast","year":" 2015"},{"IMDBId":"tt2401807","title":"Rage","year":" 2014"},{"IMDBId":"tt2382396","title":"Joe","year":" 2013"},{"IMDBId":"tt2005374","title":"The Frozen Ground","year":" 2013"},{"IMDBId":"tt0481499","remarks":["(voice)"],"title":"The Croods","year":" 2013"},{"IMDBId":"tt1656186","title":"Stolen","year":" 2012"},{"IMDBId":"tt1071875","title":"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance","year":" 2011"},{"IMDBId":"tt1674784","title":"Trespass","year":" 2011"},{"IMDBId":"tt1214962","title":"Seeking Justice","year":" 2011"},{"IMDBId":"tt1502404","title":"Drive Angry","year":" 2011"},{"IMDBId":"tt0479997","title":"Season of the Witch","year":" 2011"},{"IMDBId":"tt0963966","title":"The Sorcerer's Apprentice","year":" 2010"},{"IMDBId":"tt1250777","title":"Kick-Ass","year":" 2010"},{"IMDBId":"tt0375568","remarks":["(voice)"],"title":"Astro Boy","year":" 2009"},{"IMDBId":"tt1095217","title":"The Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call -
